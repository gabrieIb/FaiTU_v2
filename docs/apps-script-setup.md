# Legacy Apps Script Instructions

This document is retained only for historical reference. The Android app no longer talks to Google Sheets or the Apps Script backend described below.

- Firestore + Firebase Auth replaced the spreadsheet infrastructure.
- Follow `docs/firebase-backend-setup.md` for the current deployment steps.
- The old Apps Script file lives at `apps-script/Code.gs` as a stub for anyone who needs to review the pre-Firebase implementation.

If you are starting fresh, you can safely ignore this file.
